                What Is Psychology?
            </h1>

    <p> 
      <small>Psychology is the scientific study of the mind and behavior. Psychologists are 
             actively involved in studying and understanding mental processes,brain functions,
             and behavior. The field of psychology is considered a "Hub Science" with strong 
             connections to the medical sciences,social sciences, and education
             (Boyack, Klavans, & Borner, 2005).At Ohio State, the Department of Psychology is 
             organized into eight areas, working to investigate critical aspects of the brain and 
             human behavior.Psychologists often apply scientific principles to explore 
             relationships between brain function, behavior, and environment. Subspecialists 
             within the field include clinical psychologists, who treat emotional well-being and 
             behavior; forensic psychologists, who may work within the judicial system; sports 
             psychologists; organizational psychologists; and more.People are fascinated by 
             psychology, and what makes humans
             tick. Why do we think and behave the way we do? We?ve all met 
             armchair psychologists claiming to have the answers, and people 
             that ask if psychologists can tell what they?re thinking. 
             The Psychology of Everything is a series of books which ebunk the 
             popular myths and pseudo-science surrounding some of life?s biggest
             questions. The series explores the hidden psychological factors 
             that drive us,from our subconscious desires and aversions, 
             to our natural social instincts. Absorbing, informative, and always 
             intriguing, each book is written by an expert in the field,
             examining how research-based knowledge compares with popular 
             wisdom, and showing how psychology can truly enrich our 
             understanding of modern life.
             Applying a psychological lens to an array of topics and 
             contemporary concerns - from sex, to fashion, to conspiracy 
             theories - The Psychology of Everything will make you look
             at everything in a new way.This FreeBook contains opening chapters
             from the following books in The Psychology of Everything Series 
             to give a flavour of what the series offers:For as long as there have been artefacts
             to discover, records kept and images
             drawn, women and men have wanted to change how they look. Cave paintings
             show body adornments and painted faces, ancient digs discover combs and
             jewellery and Egyptian tombs were packed full of elaborate masks and clothing.
             More recently women have turned to corsets and lacing, bras and rubber roll-ons,
             and men either grew facial hair or immaculately shaved at least some of it off.But
             the body remained something to be modi?ed in line with current trends and
             fashions.And then in the 20 th century dieting emerged, along with the need to
             transform the body in a more permanent way. This can be seen through the media
             and fashion industry, the changing shape of the ideal body and the rise of the
             dieting industry. It can also be seen in the backlash against dieting that emerged
             in the 1980s and the current state of play with a proliferation of dieting books and
             classes.This chapter will explore this history of dieting to illustrate the need for an
             evidence-based approach ? the notion of dieting well.Books, magazines, dieting clubs,
             newspaper articles, TV programmes, dieting aids, apps, online support groups and exercise 
             videos all make up the dieting industry.This industry has provided a resource for those 
             who need to lose weight.But it has also changed the way in which we think about body size
             in terms of the stereotypes we hold and a sense that body size can be changed.</small>

        <h2>As a graduate student in Behavioral Neuroscience, you will study behavior from a 
            biological perspective. Behavioral Neuroscience training will prepare you for a 
            research-oriented career in academics or industry.
            You will develop an expertise that spans the traditional field of psychobiology. 
            This will include training in basic brain and behavioral sciences, as well as statistical 
            and data analysis methods. Basic work will be in neuroanatomy and neurophysiology. 
            Advanced work may be in such topics as cellular and molecular neurobiology, behavioral 
            pharmacology, behavioral neuroendocrinology, behavioral neuroscience, sensory 
            psychobiology, and psychoneuroimmunology
            Other advanced work may be in the most current behavioral neuroscience and molecular 
            biological techniques - methods such as immunocytochemistry, in situ hybridization,
            radioimmunoassay, in vivo microdialysis, HPLC, ELISA, northern and western-blot analyses, 
            flow cytometry, RT-PCR, measurements of antibodies, small animal surgery, cellular 
            proliferation tests, brain lesions, behavioral testing, and voltammetric techniques. 
            Students will also develop a sophisticated foundation in research design and quantitative 
            methods that will be highly useful in designing substantive research studies and analyzing
            data from such studies.         
            Active research participation is central to the training program. You choose a faculty
            advisor early and work closely with that person on projects of mutual interest. In
            consultation with your 
            advisor, you are also encouraged to develop collaborative research interests with 
            other faculty as well as with fellow students. These collaborations are a foundation 
            from which you will build independent research programs.</h2>
